# Traffic Accident Analysis and Injury Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing traffic accident data, identifying important factors contributing to injury severity, and building a basic machine learning model to predict the risk of injury.

## Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering (e.g., weather quality, weekend, lighting conditions)
- Random Forest classification model
- Predicting accident injury chances for new scenarios

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / VSCode

## Project Outcome
Developed a clean, analysis-driven model that can predict injury likelihood based on traffic conditions.
